nagios-plugins-rabbitmq
=======================

Overview
--------
This package contains a set of nagios checks useful for monitoring a
RabbitMQ server. They use the RabbitMQ management interface with is over
HTTP and therefore have a very light profile on the nagios server.

See the [documentation](http://www.rabbitmq.com/management.html) on the
RabbitMQ management interface for more details on what it provides.

NOTE:  RabbitMQ 2.x and RabbitMQ 3.x use different ports for the management
interface. `master` is configured to use the RabbitMQ port by default (15672).
If you are running RabbitMQ 2.x, use the `rabbitmq-2.x` branch.

Status
------
Currently we have the following checks:

- check\_rabbitmq\_aliveness
  - Use the `/api/aliveness-test` API to send/receive a message.

- check\_rabbitmq\_connections
  - Use the `/api/connections` API to gather details of connections used,
    their state and their throughput

- check\_rabbitmq\_objects
  - Use a variety of APIs to count instances of various objects on the
    server. These include vhosts, exchanges, bindings, queues and
    channels.

- check\_rabbitmq\_overview
  - Use the `/api/overview` API to collect the number of pending, ready
    and unacknowledged messages on the server

- check\_rabbitmq\_partition
  - Use the `/api/nodes` API to check for partitions in a RabbitMQ cluster.

- check\_rabbitmq\_cluster
  - Use the `/api/nodes` API to check how many node are alived in the cluster.

- check\_rabbitmq\_queue
  - Use the `/api/queue` API to collect the number of pending, ready and
    unacknowledged messages and the number of consumers on a given queue

- check\_rabbitmq\_server
  - Use the `/api/nodes` API to gather resource usage of the rabbitmq server
    node

- check\_rabbitmq\_shovels
  - Use the `/api/nodes` API check that all the shovels of the given RabbitMQ
    host are running

- check\_rabbitmq\_watermark
  - Use the `/api/nodes` API to check to see if mem_alarm has been set to true

See the relevant POD documentation/man pages for more information on usage.
